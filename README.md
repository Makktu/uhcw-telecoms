# TELECOMS APP

A location and phone search for a large hospital.

Currently building out the functionality of the app before embarking on the design. [Figma Prototype viewable here](https://www.figma.com/proto/SSQWbRJUFlf0eBMC2lIVV4/Tutorial?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0%3A1&viewport=398%2C317%2C1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2%3A5)

To fix (as of 2 June 2022):

-   Pop-up keyboard obscures the Location search buttons; keyboard has to be dismissed by the user to get at the buttons. This is awkward.
-   "Show All" - these results, sometimes 100s of them, should be shown in a modal window. I can get the results to show but cannot dismiss them. So currently I've placed the results within a <div> tag on the HTML side of the app. I am still figuring out the ins and outs of Ionic components (and whether or not to stick with Ionic).
